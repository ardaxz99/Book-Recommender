    """*GraphSage* algorithm. See :ref:`GraphSage` for more details.

    .. NOTE::
        This algorithm is implemented in PyTorch.

    .. CAUTION::
        GraphSage can only be used in ``ranking`` task.

    .. versionadded:: 0.12.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    task : {'ranking'}
        Recommendation task. See :ref:`Task`.
    data_info : :class:`~libreco.data.DataInfo` object
        Object that contains useful information for training and inference.
    loss_type : {'cross_entropy', 'focal', 'bpr', 'max_margin'}, default: 'cross_entropy'
        Loss for model training.
    paradigm : {'u2i', 'i2i'}, default: 'i2i'
        Choice for features in model.

        - ``'u2i'`` will combine user features and item features.
        - ``'i2i'`` will only use item features, this is the setting in the original paper.

    embed_size: int, default: 16
        Vector size of embeddings.
    n_epochs: int, default: 10
        Number of epochs for training.
    lr : float, default 0.001
        Learning rate for training.
    lr_decay : bool, default: False
        Whether to use learning rate decay.
    epsilon : float, default: 1e-8
        A small constant added to the denominator to improve numerical stability in
        Adam optimizer.
    amsgrad : bool, default: False
        Whether to use the AMSGrad variant from the paper
        `On the Convergence of Adam and Beyond <https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryQu7f-RZ>`_.
    reg : float or None, default: None
        Regularization parameter, must be non-negative or None.
    batch_size : int, default: 256
        Batch size for training.
    num_neg : int, default: 1
        Number of negative samples for each positive sample.
    dropout_rate : float, default: 0.0
        Probability of a node being dropped. 0.0 means dropout is not used.
    remove_edges : bool, default: False
        Whether to remove edges between target node and its positive pair nodes
        when target node's sampled neighbor nodes contain positive pair nodes.
        This only applies in 'i2i' paradigm.
    num_layers : int, default: 2
        Number of GCN layers.
    num_neighbors : int, default: 3
        Number of sampled neighbors in each layer
    num_walks : int, default: 10
        Number of random walks to sample positive item pairs. This only applies in
        'i2i' paradigm.
    sample_walk_len : int, default: 5
        Length of each random walk to sample positive item pairs.
    margin : float, default: 1.0
        Margin used in `max_margin` loss.
    sampler : {'random', 'unconsumed', 'popular', 'out-batch'}, default: 'random'
        Negative sampling strategy. The ``'u2i'`` paradigm can use ``'random'``, ``'unconsumed'``,
        ``'popular'``, and the ``'i2i'`` paradigm can use ``'random'``, ``'out-batch'``, ``'popular'``.

        - ``'random'`` means random sampling.
        - ``'unconsumed'`` samples items that the target user did not consume before.
          This can't be used in ``'i2i'`` since it has no users.
        - ``'popular'`` has a higher probability to sample popular items as negative samples.
        - ``'out-batch'`` samples items that didn't appear in the batch.
          This can only be used in ``'i2i'`` paradigm.

    start_node : {'random', 'unpopular'}, default: 'random'
        Strategy for choosing start nodes in random walks. ``'unpopular'`` will place a higher
        probability on unpopular items, which may increase diversity but hurt metrics.
        This only applies in ``'i2i'`` paradigm.
    focus_start : bool, default: False
        Whether to keep the start nodes in random walk sampling. The purpose of the
        parameter ``start_node`` and ``focus_start`` is oversampling unpopular items.
        If you set ``start_node='popular'`` and ``focus_start=True``, unpopular items will
        be kept in positive samples, which may increase diversity.
    seed : int, default: 42
        Random seed.
    device : {'cpu', 'cuda'}, default: 'cuda'
        Refer to `torch.device <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensor_attributes.html#torch.device>`_.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0
           Accept str type ``'cpu'`` or ``'cuda'``, instead of ``torch.device(...)``.

    lower_upper_bound : tuple or None, default: None
        Lower and upper score bound for `rating` task.
